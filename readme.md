####1. P-Codes
-----
P-code is an abbreviated term for 'Place Code'. P-codes are similar to zip codes and postal codes and can form part of a data management system that provides unique reference codes to thousands of place locations. These codes provide a systematic means of linking and exchanging data and analysing relationships between them.


P Codes used here were sourced from UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) titled [ **Zimbabwe P-Codes, Administrative Divisions, v1.3** ] *Date obtained*: 20 November 2013.
